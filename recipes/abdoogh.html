            This refreshing soup, made with cooling ingredients and served icy cold, is the perfect light lunch on a hot day. I enjoy it all summer-and I always have the best naps after eating it.

        <h3>
            You can make the yogurt mixture ahead and keep it in the fridge and just dish out a bowl whenever you like. Though optional, the rose petals make it pretty and quintessentially Persian. You can usually find food-safe dried rose petals in Middle Eastern supermarkets.

                Puree yogurt, salt, and dried mint in a blender with enough of the water to create a smooth, thin soup. It will thicken some when you add the bread.
                Divide the cucumbers, raisins, walnuts, and herbs among four bowls.
            </li>
            <li>Pour one-fourth of the yogurt mixture into each bowl.</li>
            <li>Top with rose petals, and add a few ice cubes to each bowl.</li>    
            <li>Tear bread into small pieces and add some to each bowl. Let bread soak 5 to 7 minutes before serving. Serve cold.</li>
